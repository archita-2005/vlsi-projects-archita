# 🔬 VLSI Projects Portfolio – Archita Roy

Welcome to my personal repository of **VLSI mini-projects**, designed as part of my preparation and to explore core electronics (ECE) concepts through practical design.

This repo includes projects in **Digital Logic, CMOS Design, Verilog RTL, and Layout Optimization**, built step-by-step as I learn from scratch.

## 📁 Folder Structure 

| Folder             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Digital_Logic/`   | Logisim-based combinational and sequential circuits (4-bit Adder, Counter, FSMs) |
| `CMOS_Layouts/`    | Stick diagrams and layout designs using CMOS principles (Inverter, NAND, Shift Register) |
| `Verilog_Projects/`| RTL projects with Verilog, including testbenches, waveforms, and custom layout optimizations |

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms Used

- [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) – Digital logic simulation
- [Electric VLSI](https://github.com/StaticVox/Electric-VLSI) / Microwind – CMOS layout
- [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) / [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) – Verilog simulation
- GitHub – Version control and project portfolio

---

## 🚀 In Progress

I’m gradually uploading and documenting:
- ✅ Completed Logisim circuits
- 🛠️ Layout optimization experiments (W/L sizing, stick diagrams)
- 🧪 Functional simulations of Verilog projects with waveforms

---

## 🧾 Goals

- Deepen conceptual understanding alongside GATE preparation  
- Build a hands-on project portfolio for internships and core placements  
- Track progress and share learnings in open-source spirit 🌱
