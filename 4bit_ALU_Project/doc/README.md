## ✅ How to Run

1. Open `alu.v` and `alu_tb.v` in ModelSim
2. Compile both files
3. Start simulation using `ALU_TB` module
4. View waveform or console output

### 🧪 Simulation Output

Due to setup limitations, the waveform simulation could not be visualized directly on my local system. However, all operations were verified using console outputs in ModelSim.

> 📄 A sample waveform is included below to illustrate expected behavior.
